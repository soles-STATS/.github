This project aims to streamline the teaching of statistics and mathematics fundamentals at the University of Sydney's [School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES)](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-life-and-environmental-sciences.html). It focuses on enhancing often-overlooked skills like open science 🧪, data wrangling 🪢, and scientific reporting 📝, while addressing gaps and overlaps in related undergraduate courses.


### 🚧 Under development 🚧

We are currently in the *early* development phase of this project which will run in 2023. The pilot phase will run in 2024, and will focus on a select number of first and second year Units of Study at SOLES. For more information please check our site (also open-source!) - under construction.
