They are a [recursive acronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym) (we are still looking for a better name for our group, so this may change in the near future).

The goal of this project is to unify the teaching of statistics and mathematics fundamentals across curriculums at the University of Sydney's [School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES)](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-life-and-environmental-sciences.html), emphasising on often-neglected skills such as open science, data wrangling and scientific reporting, and addressing noticeable gaps and overlap between undergraduate units that delve into mathematical and statistical concepts.

ðŸš§ **Note that this project is still in its infancy and will most likely not be ready until 2024.** ðŸš§ If you are a unit coordinator at SOLES and are interested in contributing, please contact [ Januar Harianto](mailto:januar.harianto@sydney.edu.au).
